## Proposal

The performance of the attendance count for a room of any use using 2 (two) ultrasonic distance sensors, the HC-SR204, to control the entrance and exit of the room.
To prove the concept, the assembly will be carried out using a quete that represents a room, assumed to be in a hallway or similar construction, and the mounting of the sensors will be as follows form:

• A sensor on the inside, preferably near the door, checking if the external sensor was triggered to decide if it is an input if otherwise it is an output.

• A sensor in the hallway, preferably at a distance close to the door, checking if the internal sensor has been activated to decide if ́ an output otherwise it is an input.
